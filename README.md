Oracowl is an application written in Flutter that provides several tools to astrophotographers looking for an all-in-one 
toolset application for planning their shooting sessions.

It features weather forecast and astronomical calculators for both deep sky and planetary imaging. It relies on an API service hosted on api.oracowl.io to make these calculations and on WeatherAPI for the weather forecast data.

If you want to help localize Oracowl in your language (right now only Italian and English are available) [shoot me an email](mailto:astropills.it@gmail.com). :)
